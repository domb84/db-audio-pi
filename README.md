# Teac T-H300DAB mkII Audio Streaming Project

This is a Python project to utilise the chassis, front controlls and VFD of a Teac T-H300DAB tuner as an audio streamer.

Along with a Pi "Hat" design and a Hifiberry DAC (or clone), this Python code should allow you to control the audio streamer from the front panel.
